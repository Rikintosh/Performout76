# Performout 76
An app to optimize game textures and your favorite mods!

Done mainly for beth titles like skyrim of F4, but should work for any game/program with DDS textures.

A fork of Octagon by Saiska.

I noticed that the author didn't update this great tool anymore, it wasn't working with the new versions of texdiag and texconv, and also had problems handling some fallout 76 textures. I fixed it, and made the tool a little more dedicated to games Fallout, instead of skyrim.

You can use this to apply filters, rescale, change format and compression of all DDS textures.
Also support GMIC for advanced manipulation.
